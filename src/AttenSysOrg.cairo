//CREATE A NEW BRANCH ON THE REPO BASED ON MAIN
//THEN MAKE PR'S FROM THE BRANCH.


//Todo
//ability to create organization profile, each org info should be saved properly, use mappings and structs where necessary
// each orgnization/school should have info for instructors, & students
//abilty for instructors to create class
//ability for students to be able to register for the class
//ability for students to mark attendance for each class attended
//batch issuance of certification by organization owner (rather than subscribing to the use of nft, a simple bool should suffice, NFT's can be introduced in one of the phases)
//read functions for all informatoion saved in storage, for example, organization profile, student profile, instructor profile.
//read function for cetification status of student for a particular course for a particular school (use nested mappings where necessary).
//function to get all registered organization profile
//function to get all classes created within a paticular organzation
// a function to make changes to organization that, like number of classes they intend to create(whether increase or decrease it), or organization name
//function to return all classes registered for by a student
//function to obtain class created by several instructors (let batch return this, like, passin in an array of instructor addresses, to return all classes created)
//Overall, include necessary read functions that would be helpful for smooth frontend integrations.


//organization profile should include, organization owners, total number of students, number of instructors and any other info you deem fit 
//also, in the process of building, include functions you deem fit for the project. 
//in advent of not been able to save arrays in storage, utilize "VEC"
//this is not the final todo, it may be updated has we work along. 
//if You have any questions, please do well to reach out.
//GOD SPEED.
